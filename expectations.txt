Camara, Joenzsen Jonner H.

I expect myself to be comfortable by using github to work with other people.
I also expect myself to become more knowledgeable about CSS and HTML, and finally,
I expect myself to fully grasp what CMSC 100 is really about.

    I agree that this course will introduce us to Git and GitHub, enabling us to use
    them comfortably in our everyday work. Given that this course focuses on Web
    Programming, I also expect to gain new knowledge about HTML, CSS, especially
    JavaScript, and its framework that we can use in our future profession.
